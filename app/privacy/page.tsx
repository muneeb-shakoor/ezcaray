          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Virtual X gets and uses personal information. We also explain why we are collecting this information and what rights all of our users have when it comes to their privacy.</p>

          <p>If you choose to use our website, you agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. Please look over the following meanings before going any further.</p>

          <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal Data is information or data about a person who can be recognised or found. An identifiable person is a real person whose name, ID number, or address can be used directly or indirectly to find out who they are. You can also tell who someone is by things about their cultural, economic, psychological, or social identity. This explanation is the same as GDPR (5th bullet point).</li>
            <li>A Data Controller is the legal entity in charge of deciding what data is gathered, how it is collected, and what it is used for. In this case, Virtual X is the one in charge of the data.</li>
            <li>A Data Processor is a person, business, or other organisation that handles data at the request of a Data Controller. One Data Controller can work with more than one Data Processor at the same time.</li>
            <li>Processing Personal Data means doing anything that has to do with the Personal Data of people. This includes, but is not limited to, getting the data, storing it, processing it, changing it, sending it somewhere else, and getting rid of it.</li>
            <li>The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is the REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Collecting Personal Data</h2>
          <p>Virtual X gathers Personal Data to help our users and make our website better. We get Personal Data in a number of different ways.</p>
          <p>For example, when you make an account on our website, you give us information like your name and contact information like your email address, phone number, and country of residence. We have to get this information from you so that we can finish setting up your account. Also, if you want to reach us, you&apos;ll need to fill out the contact form with your information so we can answer your question and help you.</p>
          <p>There is also a chance that Virtual X will collect other, less specific details about you based on your demographics. With this Personal Data, we can find out more about our guests and make their experience better.</p>
          <p>The information you give us is kept private and will only be used in ways that are necessary for our services and website to work. We won&apos;t share any of your private information without your permission. By making an account, getting in touch with us, or using any of our services, you agree that we can collect your Personal Data.</p>
        </div>

        <div className='privacy-container'>
          <h2>4. Processing Personal Data</h2>
          <p>Virtual X can properly use your personal information because of the following:</p>
          <p><span>Contractual: </span>In order to give you our services, we need to get your personal information.</p>
          <p><span>Legal Compliance: </span>We have to collect Personal Data from users because the GDPR and other rules say we have to.</p>
          <p><span>Reasonable Interest: </span>According to the GDPR, we can override your right to privacy if we can show that we have a reasonable interest in collecting your Personal Data.</p>
          <p><span>Consentual Collection:</span>There are times when we may take Personal Data for reasons other than those listed above. In this situation, we&apos;ll always ask for clear permission.</p>
          <p>Virtual X is not the direct Data Processor and is not in charge of keeping data on its servers. We give your information to the broker who is in charge of you. This broker is the Data Processor and is in charge of everything that has to do with how your data is handled. If you have questions, you should talk to your broker.</p>

When a deal is going on, we&apos;d like to let you know about it. To do this, you&apos;ll need to tell us how to get in touch with you so we can handle it.</p>

Any requests for your Personal Data will be carefully looked over to see if they are valid and if they are more important than the privacy rights of our users.</p>
